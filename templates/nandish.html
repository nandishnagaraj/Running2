                <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; color: #808080; font-size: 14px;">
                    <em>I am not just a fitness enthusiast but a testament to determination and consistency. My journey began in 2011-12 when playing with my young daughter became a challenge. Weighing over 105 kilos, I decided to reclaim my college-level fitness.</em>
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; color: #808080; font-size: 14px;">
                    <em>The path wasn't easy. I started with swimming, then tried badminton and cycling. In 2013, a friend introduced me to a running group at Cubbon Park. Balancing family and fitness was tough, but weekend runs became a routine.</em>
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; color: #808080; font-size: 14px;">
                    <em>What began as a weekend activity soon became a passion. In 2015, I joined a running club closer to home. Here, I discovered the power of community. Running became a shared journey rather than a solo effort.</em>
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; color: #808080; font-size: 14px;">
                    <em>Over the years, I've completed many races, including 8 full marathons. My personal best is 3:39, achieved in 2022. For me, fitness is about habits, consistency, and the right environment. Small daily improvements lead to big progress.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; color: #808080; font-size: 14px;">
                    <em>With the same passion, Iâ€™m happy to share my experience and train others in their running journey. I coach people to run efficiently and achieve their personal goals. My journey shows that fitness is a continuous journey, not a destination.</em>
